# Bootstrap scripts
This directory contains scripts to set up an environment with Nix flakes support.
Included are shell scripts that format a drive with an EFI and system partition
with optional disk encryption of the main partition.
The format and install scripts are intended to be run from a NixOS install image,
and can be directly executed from an environment that does not have Nix flakes
support.
